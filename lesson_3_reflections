When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

ans:If I feel that my pc is not working fine and i might lose some information.So I would like to use a remote repository instead so that i
pull requests from there.

Q.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

ans:Because we don't want to pull every change that is made on the remote repository.We only want to pull changes that have considerable effect on our project


Q.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

ans:clone means cloning a remote repository onto our local computer.Fork means to clone a github repository onto our github repository and branches are just
series of commits that one would like to experiment or try.Clone is used if we have to copy a repository from github onto our local computer,fork can be similarly used
from github to github and branches will be used to try out something different and commit it without affecting the rest of the code
