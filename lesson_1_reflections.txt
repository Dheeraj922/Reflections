Q.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

ans:I simply compared the two versions at the lines where they were different and then checked for typos.
In this way i was able to see the bug.

Q.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because I can easily revert back to any previous version.Also I can figure out how my new version is different 
and better than the previous one.

Q.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does? 

ans:Pros:-we can define ourselves when to commit and also adjust commits according to our requirements.
Cons:-the same problem of 'too early' or 'too big' can arise.

Q.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit
, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

ans:probably because that commit reflects over all the files.and also we should be able to see the status of other
files at the time of commit.

Q.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

ans:git log gives the entire history of commits made and git diff gives the record of updates made by giving the 
no of lines added or deleted.

Q.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

ans:while making a commit we can accidentlly modify our code thus producing troubles.

Q.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

ans:I would like to start using git for my projects i.e how I can use git for my projects.
